### A. Install Java

1. Install OpenJDK;
```
# yum install java-x.x.x-openjdk.x86_64
```

2. Check Java version;
```
# java -version
openjdk version "x.x.x_xxx"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build x.x.x_xxx-xxx)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build xx.xxx-xxx, mixed mode)
```

3. Setup `JAVA_HOME` and `JRE_HOME` path for all user;
```
# sudo cp /etc/profile /etc/profile_backup
# echo 'export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre-x.x.x-openjdk' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
# echo 'export JRE_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jre' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
source /etc/profile
```

4. Verify the paths;
```
# echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/jre-x.x.x-openjdk
```
```
# echo $JRE_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/jre
```

---

### B. Install Tomcat

1. Download Tomcat from `http://tomcat.apache.org/` and extract;
```
# cd /opt
# wget http://us.mirrors.quenda.co/apache/tomcat/tomcat-x/vx.x.xx/bin/apache-tomcat-x.x.xx.tar.gz
# tar xzf apache-tomcat-x.x.xx
# mv apache-tomcat-x.x.xx tomcat
```

2. Configure a Tomcat user for Tomcat Web Application Manager;
```
# vi /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml
```    
```    
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
    <tomcat-users>
        <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
        <role rolename="manager-script"/>
        <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
        <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
        <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
        <role rolename="admin-script"/>
        <user username="tomcat" password="tomcat" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>
    </tomcat-users>
```

3. Open port `8080` from firewalld and reload the configuration;
```
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
# firewall-cmd –reload
```

4. Start tomcat;
```
# cd /opt/tomcat/bin
# ./startup.sh
```

5. Check if the server is listening on port 8080;
```
# netstat -an | grep 8080
tcp6       0      0 :::8080       :::*          LISTEN
```

6. Browse to `http://localhost:8080` and Tomcat index page should load.

### C. Install Jenkins
1. Download the WAR from `http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war`;
```
# cd /opt
# wget http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
```

2. Jenkins saves configuration/jobs file under `/home/USER/.jenkins` directory by default. To choose a different location, define `JENKINS_HOME` in path;
```
# mkdir /opt/jenkins
# echo 'export JENKINS_HOME=/opt/jenkins/' | sudo tee -a /etc/profile
source /etc/profile
```

3. Login to Tomcat Web Application Manager, `http://localhost:8080/manager/html` with `tomcat` user that we have configured in `tomcat-users.xml` file.

4. Go to the Deploy section and complete as following;
```
Context Path: /jenkins
WAR or Directory URL: /opt/jenkins.war
```
Click on Deploy.

5. Check if Jenkins has started running by looking at the `Running` column of the Application lists.

6. Go to `http://localhost:8080/jenkins` and it will ask to `Unlock Jenkins`. Copy the content and run it in terminal;
```
# cat /USER/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
  98073dfbfabe4cc8961b1225a171f8db
```
Paste the `secret` to the browser and press Continue.

7. The next page will ask you to `Install plugins`. You can either choose `Install Suggested Plugins` or you can choose `Select plugins to Install`. You can remove/add new plugins later from GUI by visiting `Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins`.
8. After plugin installation is complete, it will ask you to create a new admin account. Create the account and click Continue.
9. In the `Instance Configuration` page, it will ask for the Jenkins URL. If you prefer to have FQDN name (e.g. `https://example.com/jenkins`), set it here.

**Configuring Publish Over SSH plugin**

This plugin can be used to push code before build starts or after build finishes to a remote application server using SSH protocol. For example, if you have your code hosted in a Jenkins server and you want to push build artifacts upon completion of build process to an application servers, then this plugin can do it for you.<br /><br />
Here is an example environment which we will use to configure this plugin;  
Jenkins server: _jenkins1_  
Application server: _app1_  
Jenkins user (exists on both jenkins1 and app1): _juser_  

To install the plugin and configure the plugin for remote application server, do the following;

1. Go to `Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins` and search for `publish over ssh` and then install the plugin.

2. Create an user, `juser` on both `jenkins1` and `app1`.

3. Create ssh key in the `jenkins1` for `juser`;
```
# ssh-keygen
```

3. Copy the public key of `juser` in `jenkins1` to `app1`;
```
# ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub juser@app1 
```

4. Login to `app1` as `juser` and check if it has the `authorized_keys` file;
```
# ls -la /usr/juser/.ssh/
total 4
-rw------- 1 juser juser 397 Oct  1 15:53 authorized_keys
```

5. Login to `jenkins1` server as `juser` and check if `app1` server info is listed in `known_hosts` file;
```
# cat /usr/juser/.ssh/known_hosts | grep system
```

6. Login to `jenkins1` GUI, and go to `Manage Jenkins > Configure System`. In the `Publish over SSH` section, add the following;
```
Path to key=/usr/juser/.ssh/id_rsa
SSH Servers
Name=Application
Hostname=app1.example.com
Username=juser
```
Click on `Test Configuration` and it should yield `Success`. If not, verify that `juser` can ssh to `app1` from `jenkins1` without password.
