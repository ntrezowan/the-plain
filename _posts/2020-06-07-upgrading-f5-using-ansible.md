2. Install Ansible
          
         # python -m pip install ansible

3. Install F5 Modules (v1) for Ansible and F5 SDK for Python

### B. Create the playbook

The following playbook will check if the unit is in standby state and if so, then it will do the following;
1. Prompt for the BIGIP version that you want to install (assuming ISO is located in /Users/xxx/Downloads/)
2. Verify the runnning configuration
3. Download a configuration backup to user's Downloads folder
4. Download a qkview to user's Downloads folder
5. Upload the ISO image from user's Download folder to BIGIP (in /shared/images)
6. Install the ISO to a paritition, make the partition as active on boot and then it will restart to the new version.
