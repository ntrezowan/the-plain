#### ULS log are not writing in Diagonstic folder”

This can happen when we start sharing the log folder with other users. To solve issue, do the following;
1. Go to `Services` and find which user is running `SharePoint Tracking Service`;

2. Go to `Computer Management > Local Users and Groups > Group > Performance Log Users`. Add `SharePoint Tracking Service account` (Default is `Local Service`) to `Performance Log Users` group  

3. Check the log folder and if it still does not start writing in the folder, then restart `SharePoint Tracking Service` from `Services`

4. Also verify if the following users have `Read`, `Write` and `Special Permission` on the log folder;  
```
WSS_RESTRICTED_WPG_V4(Server1\WSS_RESTRICTED_WPG_V4)
WSS_ADMIN_WPG(Server1\WSS_ADMIN_WPG)
WSS_WPG(Server1\WSS_WPG)
```
