#### Base Concept:  
URL consists of HOSTNAME and URI ->> URL: `https://[HTTP::host]/[HTTP::uri]`  
URI consists of PATH and QUERY ->> `[HTTP::uri] = [HTTP::path][HTTP::query]`  

So in our example, URL ->>  
`[HTTP::host]` = `example.com`  
`[HTTP::uri]` = `/admin/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495` (everything after hostname)  
`[HTTP::path]` = `/admin/login.html` (everything after hostname and before ?)  
`[HTTP::query]` = `service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495` (everything after ?)

#### Permanent redirect all traffic to a new host but keep the URI  

You have:  
`https://example.com/`  
`https://example.com/apps/login.jsp`  

You want:  
`https://example.com/` to be redirected to `https://discovery.com`  
`https://example.com/apps/login.jsp` to be redirected to `https://discovery.com/apps/login.jsp`  

```
when HTTP_REQUEST {
  HTTP::respond 301 Location "https://discovery.com[HTTP::uri]"
}
```
To do a temporary redirect, use 302 as HTTP::respond.

#### Redirect only root path(/) to a different domain without redirecting nested URI's  

You have:  
`https://example.com/`  
`https://example.com/index.html`  
`https://example.com/apps/login.jsp`  

You want:  
`https://example.com/` to be redirected to `https://discovery.com`  
`https://example.com/index.html` to be redirected to `https://discovery.com`  
`https://example.com/apps/login.jsp` will stay as it is  

```
when HTTP_REQUEST {
  switch -glob [string tolower [HTTP::uri]] {
    "" -
    "/" {
      HTTP::redirect "https://discovery.com"
    }
    "/index.html" {
      HTTP::redirect "https://discovery.com"
    }
    default {
    }
  }
}
```

#### URL redirect while keeping HTTP query

You have:  
`https://example.com/admin/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495`  
`https://example.com/developer/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495`  
`https://example.com/user/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495`

You want:  
`https://example.com/admin/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495` to be redirected to `https://example.com/admin_new/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495`  
`https://example.com/developer/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495` to be redirected to `https://example.com/developer_new/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495`  
`https://example.com/user/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495` to be redirected to `https://example.com/user_new/login.html?service=discovery.com/loginID=8598495`  

```
when HTTP_REQUEST {
  switch -glob [string tolower [HTTP::path]] {
    "" -
    "/" {
      HTTP::redirect https://[HTTP::host]/console/login.html
    }
    "/admin/login.html" {
      HTTP::redirect https://[HTTP::host]/admin_new/login.html?[HTTP::query]
    }
    "/developer/login.html" {
      HTTP::redirect https://[HTTP::host]/developer_new/login.html?[HTTP::query]
    }
    "/user/login.html" {
      HTTP::redirect https://[HTTP::host]/user_new/login.html?[HTTP::query]
    }
    default {
    }
  }
}
```
